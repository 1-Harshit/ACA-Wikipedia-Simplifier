We created a python environment in which agents could cooperate or defect while competing for resources, with different rewards. We created three types of agents, one cooperative, one defective and one tit-for-tat. Then, we used Deep Q learning to create another agent, which learns the best possible strategy for survival using Reinforcement learning having only the populations of each type and past interactions(only the numbers, interactions with each individual agents were not tracked) as known state variables.
